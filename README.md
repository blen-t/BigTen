# BigTen
Team Members: Blen, Dua, Alex, Melody, Nick

Project Description: We created a database that tracks the Big Ten Conference since University of Maryland is one of the fourteen schools in the Big Ten. We compared the different aspects of the universities such as tuition, enrollment, degree statistics, college demographics, etc. We limited the years we were seeking data for, which lessened the risk of running into an overwhelming amount of data.
